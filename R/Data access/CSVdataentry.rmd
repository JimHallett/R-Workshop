Many people use Excel, but unfortunately it is not the best mechanism for storing data long term. It  poses some issues for getting the data into R for analysis (i.e., multiple sheets). The best method is to save each datasheet as a csv (comma-separated values) file. Then to input the data use:

read.csv("directory and filename", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

The header should include the variable names. The separator (sep) is normally a comma. 

```{r}
df <- read.csv("D:/fishdata.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")  #Enter the data
summary(df)   #Produce a short summary of the data
```

These data will be used for a number of subsequent explorations.
