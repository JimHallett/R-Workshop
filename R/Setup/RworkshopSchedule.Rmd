##What is R and what are its virtues?
**[Fill this in]**


##Basic building blocks of R
###Presentation 1: Functions, arguments and getting help
**Writing R is like writing in English**

- Anatomy of an R command
- Action and modifiers akin to function and arguments
- Illustrate the role of parentheses, equal sign, and comma
- Show when to use argument names, and when to just use positions
- Illustrate functions within functions
- Saving output as objects 

**Getting help**

- Look at the package and function documentation
- Search in www.rseek.org or Google
- QuickR
- Swirl
- Ask a friend
- Ask a stackoverflow or the R-help mailing list. But first make sure you have the latest version of R and relevant packages, and have looked for related problems on the site, and if you've done both of those and no luck, spend some time making a reproducible example!
- Meta-learning: Look at source code; form a hypothesis about what the code does and test it

###Exercise 1
1) In it's simplest form, R can be used as an interactive calculator. 
2) Functions can replace basic algebraic operators.
3) Results can be stored and reused as objects.
4) A collection of values can be stored as a vector.
5) Vectors can be created as sequences of numbers.
6) Values can be characters as well as numbers.
7) Getting help as we go along.
